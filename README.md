# Substance to Maya
## version 0.1

This tool is used to automatically connect Substance Painter textures to Maya.  

Supported render engines and materials: 
* Arnold - aiStandardSurface
* VRay - VrayMtl
* Renderman - PxrDisney
* Renderman - PxrSurface
* Redshift - RedshiftMaterial
* Stingray - StingrayPBS

## Installation
* Put the SubstancePainterToMaya folder in a maya script directory   
(I.e: C:\Users\user\Documents\maya\scripts on Windows)    
![install_path](pics/01_installPath.jpg)  

* The content of the folder need to be this one  
![Folder content](pics/02_folderContent.jpg)  
 
* Create a shelf button in Maya with the following Python command  
![Shelf command](pics/04_shelfContent.jpg)  

Here the text version for copy+paste :  

from SubstancePainterToMaya import main  
reload(main)  
main.SPtoM()

## New

UDIM option added in the Options part of the UI.  
See the UDIM part of this documentation

## Features details

* #### Texture folder
Choose the folder that contains your Substance Painter textures  
Click **Get** to open a dialog and choose the folder  
By default, the tool uses the sourceImages folder of your project

* #### Naming convention
Enter the textureSet name and the map name of one of your textures.  
Be careful with the lowers and the CAPITALS letters  
[More on the naming convention](NamingConvention.md)

* #### Renderer
Choose the renderer you want to use  

* #### Materials
**Create new ones if they doesn't exist, instead use existing ones**  
If the tool find shaders named like your textures's textureSet, and if the shaders are the ones used by your renderer, the textures will be plugged in those shaders, instead, the tool will create new shaders with the name and '_shd' as suffix. 
**Create new ones**  
The tool will create new shaders and plug the textures in them and add '_shd' suffix to the found name.  
**Use existing ones**  
If the tool find shaders named like your textures's textureSet, and if the shaders are the ones used by your renderer, the textures will be plugged in those shaders, instead, nothing will append.

* #### Launch and Re-launch
Click this button to search for the textures and create the second part of the UI.  
Click the Re-launch button if you've changed the texture folder, the naming convention, the renderer, or after you've moved new textures in the Texture Folder and want to use that changes.

* #### Found Maps
Based on your Naming Convention, the tool will create lines  
On the left are the found maps, and for each name, a dropdown menu is created on it's right to let you specify in which parameter you want to plug that map.   
The script automatically purpose parameters for usual maps  
(I.e: baseColor, BaseColor, albedo... are related to the baseColor/diffuse parameter, but you can choose another one in the dropdown menu)   

* #### Options
**Use height as bump**  
If enabled, the height maps will be used as bump maps (if there's also a normalMap, both will be used)  
**Use height as displace**  
If enabled, the height maps will be used as displacement maps     
**Add colorCorrect node after each file node**  
If enabled, the tool will add a colorCorrect node after each file node  
**Add subdivisions**  
If enabled, you can add subdivisions to the meshes or materials (depending of your render engine)

* #### Proceed
Click this button to import the textures, create the nodes and connect everything

## UDIM

* The textureSet name here is your FBX file name (used by Substance Painter as part of the texture name, without the .fbx extension)

* As the script uses the textureSet as the material name, 
I recommand you to export your FBX to substancePainter with the name of the material instead of the name of the object.
* This way the exported maps will have your material's name as part of their name and you can use it in the textureSet part of the script.
* If you don't do it this way, you have two solutions:
    1. Let the things as they are and manually connect the new materials to your objects. 
    2. Rename your assigned materials to be the same as your FBX file names.
    
### UDIM process example

* I got a mesh MyCharacter with a MyCharacterShader material on it.
* I export my mesh with UDIM as MyCharacterShader.fbx
* I do the textures in Substance Painter using the "Create a texture set per UDIM tile"
* I export my maps which are named like "MyCharacterShader_1001_BaseColor.png"
* In Maya I launch the script and use MyCharacterShader as textureSet name and BaseColor as map name
* Tadaaaaaaam everything is connected and the UDIM are automatically working.
